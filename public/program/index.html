                <h6 class="bold-subtitle">Path to STEAMConf 2019</h6>
                <p>A meeting powered by teachers for teachers. A free and open invitation for everyone to share and build knowledge, experiences, ideas, concerns and to prepare ahead for the three days of STEAMConf conversations, debates, workshops and conferences.</p>

                <h3>Is this your first EdCamp?</h3>
                <p>If so, don’t worry! Here you’ll have the chance to discover what it is about and experience it for yourself. An EdCamp is a meeting designed to share knowledge, concerns and passions about education. It is based on knowledge-sharing and growing among equals, through discussions and exchanges in an open and stimulating environment that facilitates the free circulation of ideas.</p>

                <h3>Is there a programme?</h3>
                <p>An EdCamp has no specific programme because it is the participants that create the programme or the map of the sessions together, based on subjects, questions and concerns that are of interest to them.</p>

                <h3>Who can initiate the conversation?</h3>
                <p>Everyone is welcome to lead and initiate a session based on their own conversation proposal.</p>

                  <h6><strong>Helena González</strong> and <strong>Oriol Marimon</strong>, Big Van Ciencia, IES Moises Broggi, IES Consell de Cent and IES Castellbisbal (Barcelona); <strong>Casimiro Vizzini</strong>, Expert at UNESCO&rsquo;s Division of Science Policy and Capacity Building</h6>

                  <p>At myPERFORM we talk about science with responsibility; we tackle social challenges, ethical dilemmas and gender inequalities; we identify pseudoscience and conflicts of interest but above all, we have a great time, we explore humour and we build scientific stories and perform them on stage.</p>
                  <p>The myPERFORM project uses the performing arts to create an inclusive environment in which young people work together with researchers, their professors and science communicators, to explore science and technology issues and values. The final product of these participatory methodologies is a theatre piece (a scientific monologue, a sketch, a story ...) that can be represented on stage and that talks about real scientific or technological research. myPERFORM has made learning a participatory, &#34;humanised&#34; activity, put into the local context of students, and has contributed to the development of a reflective and informed population through science.</p>
                  <p>The presentation of the myPERFORM project will be a spectacle. Literally. A show in which the monologues and theatrical sketches made by students from various schools in Barcelona will be interspersed, where we can answer questions such as; what can we do to stop climate change? How do we look for life on other planets? What new technologies are there for fighting cancer?</p>
                  <p>MyPERFORM follows from the successes of its predecessor, the European Commission funded PERFORM project, to implement performance-based science education processes in countries worldwide.</p>
                  <p>PERFORM has been a project financed by the European Commission, implemented in Spain, the United Kingdom and France. The design and implementation of pedagogical activities has been led by Big Van Science (www.bigvanciencia.com).</p>
                  <p>The Educational Centers that participated in the PERFORM project that will tell us the science from the scene are IES Moises Broggi, IES Consell de Cent and IES Castellbisbal.</p>

                  <p>This presentation offers an overview of the last ten years of learning at Tate, exploring changes in practice, theoretical influences and the pragmatics of working in a large art museum. It looks at the current social and cultural landscape and suggests an imperative for change that requires us to reflect on what we need to make or break in order to generate relevant and meaningful experiences with art that meet the needs of our responsibilities to students.</p>

                  <p>We will delve into what it means to design STEAM-based learning experiences that fully embrace tinkerability as a way to engage young people; physically, intellectually and emotionally. When learners are tinkering, wonder and delight are ever-present – and that is fun. So why is it undervalued in education? It’s a pedagogy based on active engagement with materials and ideas aimed at cultivating curiosity. We&#39;ll highlight dimensions of learning found in tinkering; a process where teachers and learners are changing their relationships to ideas, science phenomena, and each other -- redefining what counts as learning.</p>

The location of the project at the Sant Agustí Convent Civic Centre is no accident. Creation processes in the DIWO area, alignment with work in the local network and the technological innovation of the centre make it an ideal space.</p>

                  <p>Sonic Pi is a free educational environment for learning to code. It is possible for beginners to code fresh beats, driving bass lines and shimmering synth riffs. All this whilst learning core computer science concepts such as sequencing, functions, variables, loops, data structures and algorithms. In this demo-heavy talk we’ll cover Sonic Pi&#39;s history — why it was created, how it evolved and what it can do today —. We&#39;ll also discuss how and why many of Sonic Pi&#39;s classroom-focussed design decisions turned out to be fantastically useful for professional musicians (and vice-versa).</p>

                  <p>In 0.51 seconds, a Google search brings you over 139 million results for “21st century skills”. No doubt, educational levels from elementary schools to universities are buzzing about lifelong learning, metacognitive skills and critical thinking. However, even though curricula around the world are starting to value these skills, assessment culture lags behind. This is also true in Finland, where the new national curriculum in 2016 introduced new ideas such as programming skills and multidisciplinary learning but left the teacher-led assessment culture largely untouched. In his talk, Nieminen will introduce the newest research results concerning digital and innovative assessment from the University of Helsinki. It is argued that the core of our assessment methods has actually been pretty much the same for hundreds of years and ‘radical’ attempts to change it have not always end well. How could digital self- and peer-assessment support accessibility, student empowerment and ownership of learning?</p>

His research field is assessment of 21st century skills, concerning how innovative digital assessment could support the development of critical thinking and lifelong learning. Nieminen also works as a special educator, striving to build a more inclusive world through both his teaching and research. Currently, he is writing books on assessment culture in Finland and on innovative mathematics education, as well as working as a pedagogical specialist at Code School Finland. In addition, he is leading a math revolution with Math Hunger, aiming to make learning mathematics both fun and accessible for everyone.

                  <p>What if school was organised around the interests and natural curiosities of our students and teachers? What if the learning experience required you to get out of the building, observe the world, document findings and create/deliver beautifully crafted work that makes a real impact in the world beyond the school walls? The future of learning will look and feel less like school, as we currently know it, and more like students doing original, creative and meaningful work. Given the right conditions, young people will lead revolutions, invent new technologies, create new culture, new forms of expression, new genres of music and even new forms of government. With their boundless energy, they throw themselves into their work and they see old things in new ways. In this presentation, we’ll look at examples of student work, share some current experiments and show how we use human-centred design tools, methods and mindsets to make school more engaging, more interesting and more human. We will talk about the future of learning, school culture and creative leadership.</p>
