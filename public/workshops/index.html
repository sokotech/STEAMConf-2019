Most recently in 2011, Gever created Brightworks, a K-12 private school in San Francisco where students explore an idea from multiple perspectives with the help of real-world experts, tools and experiences; collaborate on projects driven by their curiosity; and share their findings with the world.</p>

                  <h3>Co-creating the assessment cultures of the future</h3>
                  <h6><strong>Juuso Henrik Nieminen</strong>, Mathematics Education Research Group, University of Helsinki, Finland</h6>
                  <p>What will our assessment methods look like in the future? Our knowledge about pedagogy is shaping curricula around the world but what lags behind is the educational assessment culture. In order to truly promote 21st century skills through education, our understanding of assessment has to change as well. In this research-based workshop, some Finnish examples of the assessment for learning movement are introduced. It is argued that in order to promote innovative assessment cultures, collaboration between various agents is needed. Thus, the participants will need to collaborate in order to co-create dystopian and utopian assessment cultures for the future. After discovering these extreme futures of assessment, the workshop will focus on the practical side of changing the assessment culture. How could we collaboratively create an assessment culture that would be based on supporting learning inclusively, rather than simply dividing learners into groups based on measuring their skills and knowledge?</p>

His research field is assessment of21st century skills, concerning how innovative digital assessment could support the development of critical thinking and lifelong learning. Nieminen also works as a special educator, striving to build a more inclusive world through both his teaching and research. Currently, he is writing books on assessment culture in Finland and on innovative mathematics education, as well as working as a pedagogical specialist at Code School Finland. In addition, he is leading a math revolution with Math Hunger, aiming to make learning mathematics both fun and accessible for everyone. In 2018, Nieminen curated the theme &#34;What should we learn next?&#34; at Dare to Learn, the most innovative learning festival in Finland.</p>

                  <p>On the occasion of the International Year of the Periodic Table (2019 IYPT), we present a didactic proposal in the form of an escape room that will introduce competences and knowledge on the periodic table and the elements in the classroom. The tasks and situations to be solved integrate knowledge of various fields with the backbone of the key ideas that the periodic table represents for the sciences and specifically for chemistry. The game format aims to involve students and create an enjoyable experience, while sharing knowledge and cooperating with their peers using their abilities and competences in the fields of languages, arts, social sciences, mathematics and technology.</p>

                  <p>Even if it may seem incredible, quantum physics has an important impact on our daily life; without it, we would not have developed useful technologies, like lasers, LEDs and transistors. But hold on! Many more are about to come, like 100% secure online communications and quantum computers, as we are at the beginning of a quantum technological revolution, the so called Second Quantum Revolution. The ICFO outreach team has worked in the last years on many and diverse materials that you can directly bring to the classroom to introduce some of the basic concepts that are at the base of actual research and technological development in quantum physics. With a wide range of classroom activities, from card games up to virtual tours in the quantum world, we will show you how quantum physics can get to your class, so that your students can be part of the upcoming quantum revolution!</p>

                  <p>Methods and proposals that have arisen from IRB Barcelona’s participation on the Escoles Tàndem project, an initiative by the Fundació Catalunya-La Pedrera, will be shared during this workshop. The aim is to introduce participants to the typical process of scientific knowledge building, using biomedicine as the central theme. We will share different tools, some of which can be directly implemented in the classroom, to familiarise students with the scientific method. But science isn’t just a method; we will also emphasise other essential aspects, such as team work, decision-making, creativity and error management. During the workshop some of IRB Barcelona’s research areas (cancer, ageing, the Drosophila fruit fly, Xenopus frog eggs, etc.) will be linked to learning experiences in primary and secondary education classrooms. We want biomedicine to break out of the laboratory and reach classrooms and the public. Will you give us a hand?</p>

                  <p>This workshop presents a didactic STEAM proposal, which aims to provide students in secondary education with the cognitive construction of knowledge about electricity and magnetism. This knowledge will allow us to understand the functioning of the gadgets of our civilisation, such as the generation, transportation and utilisation of electrical energy in the home, public spaces, industry, commerce and transport. The proposal is characterised by active learning through the construction of devices for experimentation, integrating elements of maker culture and 3D printing, and is reflected in several projects that can be carried out in the technology classroom and science laboratory (with exploration activities using magnets, the construction of electromagnets and motors, discovery of the principle of electromagnetism and construction of an electric generator and a wind turbine).</p>

                  <p>Technological resources are steadily moving forward and securing an indisputable place in the way in which children interact with their natural environment. Normalising their use in school allows us to create learning situations closer to the concerns and interests of the students and helps us to connect with their way of interacting with the world and to approach situations of significant learning. We understand technological tools to be resources throughout the processes of artistic learning. We propose small experiences using these resources, based on activities that we have carried out at our schools, in the context of Artistic-Plastic education. The proposals cover different moments of artistic practice; the analysis, observation and perception of the models; the tasks of designing and producing the work and the use of technologically-generated resources as teaching materials to accompany and facilitate the learning of of every student.</p>

                <p>Synapses are the connections between neurons, connections that allow us to do, think, feel, etc. Based on this idea, when we speak of &#34;artistic synapses&#34; we refer to connections between science and art, connections through images, collage style or moodboard. In this workshop we will see some of these artistic synapses, we will discuss the creative process and we will experience it. Likewise, we will discuss the application of this activity in the classroom in different contexts and we will see what can arouse in our students regarding creativity, experience and learning.</p>
